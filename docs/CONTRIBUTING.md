# How to contribute
## Open an issue
You can always open an issue if you:
* have an idea, that might improve one of our solutions
* are missing a feature
* found a bug

## Before you start coding
Feel free to contribute code! Just make sure your new features fit the component's main goal and are useful for most users. If you're not sure, let's chat about it first in an issue or discussion.

Before you dive into coding, please get to know the standards of the solution you're working on. Some solutions might have extra rules in their CONTRIBUTING.md files.

If you'd like to help with an issue but aren't sure how to implement it, just ask and we'll provide some guidance.

## Review process
We will most likely accept pull requests, provided the new version does not introduce harmful elements such as bugs or security vulnerabilities.

If your code doesn't meet our internal guidelines, we'll refactor it internally afterwards. This won't be your concern.
