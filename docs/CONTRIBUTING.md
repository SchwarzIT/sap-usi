# How to contribute
## Open an issue
You can always open an issue if you:
* have an idea, that might improve one of our solutions
* are missing a feature
* found a bug

The issues should be created in the repositor of the respective solution.

## Before you start coding
You can also contribute code, but please make sure that the new features are matching the overall purpose of the component.
If you are not sure about that, just open an issue and discuss it with us beforehand.

Please also ensure that you are familiar with the standards of the solution you want to contribute to before you start programming.
Our solutions might or might not define additional rules in their respective CONTRIBUTING.md files.

## Review process
Please do not get confused if it takes us days or - depending on the size of your contribution - even weeks to merge your changes into the main branch.
This is NOT because we do not appreciate your work or simply do not care. In fact the opposite is the case.

Every new version has to undergo a rigorous internal review process before merging.
The code has to pass:
* ATC Checks
* Unit Tests
* A manual review by a developer (Yes, we will actually read every single line of that code!)
* Manual explorative tests

The list is not necessarily complete. If applicable, we might end up writing test code to test parts of the development in isolation.
And for the sake of compliance the review has to be documented internally and at least three different colleagues will be involved.
This process simply takes some time.

Please do not get intimidated by that review process.
We will not make that your problem and we will try to keep things friendly.

As long as the new version does not introduce harmful things like e.g. bugs or security issues, we will accept the pull request.
If your code does not comply to our internal guidelines, we will refactor it internally, so that it passes the review process.
After that we will merge your version into the main branch right before pushing our refactored version.
