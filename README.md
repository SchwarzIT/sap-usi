# Who we are and what we do

The Schwarz Group operates over 800 SAP systems with about 200 of them being productive. 
Some subtasks - like sending an email or writing the application log - came up again and again over time.

The USI development chapter was created to avoid the redundant implementation of such subtasks. 
Our goal is to provide reusable solutions for such repetitive tasks, that can easily be consumed by other developers.

You can think of our developments as a developer toolbox or a technical foundation, that can be used to:
* avoid redundancies
* boost developer productivity
* enhance your products with powerful features
